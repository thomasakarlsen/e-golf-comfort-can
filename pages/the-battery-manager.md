# The battery control unit / manager

The battery control unit is a logical device available over a BAP channel. I am unsure what physical module (FSG) is actually providing this logical device. I suspect it could be the body control module (BCM) or the high-voltage battery module.

WHAT IS THE BCU?

## Battery Control Profiles

Explain what BCPs are and their data structure including the global profile 0.

## BAP messages

Explain and provide examples of how to read the BCP array and how to modify a BCP.

## Controlling climatisation using the high-voltage battery

### Waking up the vehicle

& initialising the BAP channel

### Changing climatisation settings

### Starting climatisation

### Stopping climatisation
